# Keras Implementations in NeuralNets101

Welcome to the **Keras** folder of the **NeuralNets101** repository! This folder contains various neural network implementations using **Keras**. Below, you'll find descriptions of the neural networks included in this folder:

## Neural Networks Implemented

1. **Summation Model (NN)** : This is a basic Feedforward Neural Network (NN) that learns to sum two numbers. The network takes two numeric inputs and learns to predict their sum. It demonstrates how a simple neural network can solve a basic arithmetic problem, showcasing how neural networks can model mathematical operations.

## How to Use the Keras Notebooks

To get started with the Keras notebooks, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your Environment**: Ensure you've followed the instructions in the main `README.md` to set up your Python environment and install dependencies.
2. **Explore the Notebooks**: 
   - Navigate to the `Keras` folder and open the desired Jupyter notebook.
   - Run the cells in the notebook to train the models on your local machine.
3. **Experiment**: Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different architectures, or adjust hyperparameters to see how the models perform with different configurations.

## Additional Notes

- **Model Performance**: The models in this repo serve as simple demonstrations of Keras's capabilities. Do not consider the Accuracy as the final accuracy.
- **Next Steps**: After experimenting with these networks, consider exploring more advanced architectures (like RNNs or GANs) or using different datasets to further deepen your understanding of Keras.
